## Flipkart Sentiment Analysis Project
- Developed an end-to-end Flipkart Sentiment Analysis system using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, deployed as a Streamlit web application on AWS EC2 for real-time review classification.

## Overview
- This project is an end-to-end sentiment analysis application that classifies Flipkart product reviews as Positive or Negative using NLP and machine learning techniques. The system is built with Streamlit for real-time predictions and uses TF-IDF vectorization combined with Logistic Regression for sentiment classification.
- Users can enter any product review and instantly receive sentiment feedback through a web interface.

## Objective
- To analyze customer reviews and determine sentiment polarity (positive or negative) in order to understand customer satisfaction and identify potential pain points.

### Dataset
- The dataset consists of Flipkart product reviews with the following fields:
1) Review Text
2) Rating
3) Reviewer Details (optional)

- Sentiment labeling logic:
1) Rating ≥ 4 → Positive (1)
2) Rating < 4 → Negative (0)

The application automatically detects review and rating columns from the dataset.

## Project Workflow
- Load dataset using Pandas
- Perform text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing special characters, stopword removal)
- Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate performance using F1 Score
- Save trained model and vectorizer using Joblib
- Build a Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions
- Model and Techniques
- Text cleaning using Regular Expressions and NLTK
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Machine Learning model: Logistic Regression
- Evaluation metric: F1 Score

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Streamlit
- Joblib

## How to Run Locally
1) Clone the repository:
- git clone
- cd

2) Create virtual environment:
- python -m venv venv

3) Activate environment:
- Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
